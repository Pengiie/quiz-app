# Personality Quiz
A personality quiz application built in React Native for a school project. The original application was a school project in Swift following this [guide](https://github.com/chcy1005/swift/blob/master/3.9.2/guided-project-personality-quiz.md).
<br><br>There are four difference question types:
- Single choice
- Multiple Choice
- Ranged
- Free Response

The first three were present in the original app in Swift but the last question is new and notable. The free response question determines which points it should award for the end result by using Open AI to classify the response. The code is also flexible too so you can create new free response questions and give examples for classifications to easily add more question.

The project also uses Firebase with Google OAuth2 and Firestore to save past results that can be looked at anytime. This project was mainly to learn React Native for future projects and a good experience working with Firebase in a phone app setting.
